## Genetic variants associated with chemo-resistance/recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

This project involved the analysis of Whole Exome Data from a pilot study of three HNSCC patients, with matched normal, tumour, and recurrence biopsies. Comparison of tumour-normal, recurrence-normal, and recurrence-tumour data provided information on the specific variants that may have allowed these tumours to evade treatment/recur following chemo-radiation.
